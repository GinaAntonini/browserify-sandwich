# Browserify Sandwich Maker

### Requirements:
Convert your Sandwich Maker code to use CommonJS module pattern instead of the IIFE pattern and have a Grunt task for compiling your modules.
Use XHR to load JSON files for each type of topping/bread.
Implied requirements: Lint your JS (we should get no errors if we run Grunt), informative README.md
##

### Objectives Learned/Learning Narrative:
After completing this project I was able to understand how Browserify works in compiling JS modules. The most challenging thing for me was trying to translate what I had done in the initial Sandwich Maker project (referenced below).
